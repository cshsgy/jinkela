### Automatic fetched dependencies
During the build process, the following dependencies will be fetched and cached automatically:
| Package Name | Repository URL | Version |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| fmt | [https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) | 11.1.2 |
| yaml-cpp | [https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) | 0.8.0 |
| elements | [https://github.com/chengcli/elements](https://github.com/chengcli/elements) | v1.1 |
| gtest | [https://github.com/google/googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) | v1.13.0 |
| pyharp | [https://github.com/chengcli/pyharp](https://github.com/chengcli/pyharp) | v1.1.1 |
| disort | [https://${ACCOUNT}:${TOKEN}@github.com/zoeyzyhu/pydisort](https://${ACCOUNT}:${TOKEN}@github.com/zoeyzyhu/pydisort) | 24569ab591dc |


A successful build will save a cache file for each dependence in the `.cache` directory.
These cache files can  be safely deleted at any time.
Internet connection is required for the first build and whenever after the cache is deleted.
Once the cache is populated, the build process can be repeated offline.
