"""setuptools_scm version scheme for kintera: guess-next-dev with a release floor.

setuptools_scm derives the version from git tags. A tree without usable git
metadata takes ``[tool.setuptools_scm] fallback_version`` from pyproject.toml,
except on one path: a ``git archive`` whose ``.git_archival.txt`` carries the
commit but no ``describe-name`` (an archive made by a git older than 2.32,
which cannot expand ``%(describe)``, or one taken from a clone with no
reachable release tag) is reported as ``0.0`` and the fallback is never
consulted (#125). A consumer's version floor then refuses the package.

This scheme is ``guess-next-dev`` with ``fallback_version`` applied as a
floor for a tree with no usable tag (setuptools_scm's 0.0): it never reports
a version below the release recorded in its own pyproject.toml. A tree with
a real tag keeps guess-next-dev from that tag, even one below the floor. A
tree that only knows its commit reports
``<fallback_version>+<node>``, which is at least the floor and still
distinguishable from the release itself.

It is referenced from pyproject.toml by object reference
(``version_scheme = "scm_version_scheme:floored_guess_next_dev"``), so it
applies to every reader of that configuration: ``pip install``,
``python -m build`` and ``python -m setuptools_scm``.
